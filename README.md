## 🎯 Overview

This repository provides a template and guide for implementing a scalable microservices infrastructure on AWS ECS. It focuses on:

- **Semi-Automated Deployments**: Manual control with automation scripts
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Templated configurations and deployment scripts
- **Best Practices**: Security, scaling, and monitoring implementations
- **Learning Resource**: Detailed documentation and implementation guides

## 🌟 Features

### Infrastructure
- ECS Fargate for container orchestration
- Application Load Balancer (ALB) for traffic routing
- Auto-scaling based on CloudWatch metrics
- VPC with public/private subnet architecture

### Deployment
- Automated deployment scripts
- Environment-specific configurations
- Rolling updates and rollbacks
- Container image management

### Security
- AWS Secrets Manager integration
- IAM role-based access control
- Network security with security groups
- SSL/TLS termination at ALB

### Monitoring
- CloudWatch metrics and alarms
- Health checks and logging
- Auto-scaling notifications
- Performance monitoring
